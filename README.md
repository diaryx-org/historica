# Historica

Historica is an experiment in readable, convergent version control.

The repository format follows one non-negotiable rule:

> The readable files are the authority.

A person must be able to inspect the history, understand its relationships, and
recover stored content without decoding an opaque database or binary operation
log. Binary indexes and snapshots may eventually exist as disposable caches,
but deleting every cache must lose neither information nor meaning.

## Current scope

The `core` module models the smallest collaboration-safe history:

- immutable revisions, each naming both the digest of its own bytes and the
  change it is a version of;
- explicit causal parents, named by digest, so history is a Merkle DAG;
- explicit supersession, so rewriting a change is recorded rather than hidden;
- a history that merges by set union;
- deterministic head discovery, over parents and over supersession alike;
- resolution of a change to its current revision, including the legitimate
  states of divergence and abandonment;
- rejection of two revisions with disagreeing bytes claiming one digest.

The `format` module reads and writes the revision document those revisions are
stored as. It parses strictly — one byte sequence per set of facts, so that
hashing the file is as trustworthy as hashing a canonical model would be — and
refuses anything else with an error naming the line and the fix. Writing a
parsed document reproduces its bytes exactly, and a revision's ID is the
SHA-256 that `shasum -a 256` already prints for the file.

`tests/corpus/revisions/` is the specification, executed. Seven hand-written
files are a real five-change history containing a merge, an amendment by a
reviewer, and the rewrite that amendment forced; nine more are invalid, each
for one stated reason that `tests/corpus.rs` holds the parser to.

The `store` module is that format on disk. It loads a `history/` directory by
reading files and never their names, so renaming every revision in a store
changes no identity and breaks no reference — which is what lets a store be
hand-arranged into something a file browser can narrate. The writer still names
files by digest, appends only, and never overwrites. `check` reads a store
without loading it and separates errors, which mean the store contradicts
itself, from notes, which never fail: an undelivered parent, a duplicate, or a
sync tool's conflicted copy is a legitimate state and is reported as one.

It intentionally does not yet choose a tree model, or implement the content and
merge model decided in 0007. There is no command-line front end yet either;
`init`, `check`, and `arrange` exist as decisions, and the first two as library
operations. Those should be built against readable examples
rather than hidden behind abstractions.

## Decisions

Choices that constrain later work are written down as they are made.

- [`docs/decisions/0001-identity.md`](docs/decisions/0001-identity.md) — why
  every node carries both a derived revision ID and an assigned change ID.
- [`docs/decisions/0002-revision-document.md`](docs/decisions/0002-revision-document.md)
  — the readable revision document, and why its digest covers the file rather
  than a re-serialised model. Examples live in
  [`tests/corpus/revisions`](tests/corpus/revisions).
- [`docs/decisions/0003-store.md`](docs/decisions/0003-store.md) — the store:
  identity comes from content, filenames are presentation.
- [`docs/decisions/0004-parser-contract.md`](docs/decisions/0004-parser-contract.md)
  — strict reading, the `historica-v0` preamble, and why a reader's
  vocabulary can only ever grow.
- [`docs/decisions/0005-authorship.md`](docs/decisions/0005-authorship.md) —
  authorship is copied into every revision of a change, and is a claim rather
  than evidence.
- [`docs/decisions/0006-store-questions.md`](docs/decisions/0006-store-questions.md)
  — one-line bookmarks, a visible `history/` root, and what `check` treats as
  an error rather than a note.
- [`docs/decisions/0007-content-and-merge.md`](docs/decisions/0007-content-and-merge.md)
  — a revision records what it did rather than what a file is, and concurrent
  edits merge by replay rather than by three-way heuristic.
- [`docs/loro.md`](docs/loro.md) — the initial Loro evaluation, and the
  conditions that would reverse it.

## Development

```console
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

The corpus checks with tools that are already installed, which is the claim the
format exists to make:

```console
cd tests/corpus/revisions && shasum -a 256 -c MANIFEST
```
